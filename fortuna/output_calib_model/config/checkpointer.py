        An object to configure saving and restoring of checkpoints during the calibration process.

        save_checkpoint_dir: Optional[Path] = None
            Save directory location.
        restore_checkpoint_path: Optional[Path]
            Path to checkpoint file or directory to restore.
        save_every_n_steps: int
            Number of training steps between checkpoints. To disable, set `every_n_train_steps` to None or 0 (no
            checkpoint will be saved during training).
        keep_top_n_checkpoints: int
            Number of past checkpoint files to keep.
        dump_state: bool
            Dump the fitted calibration state as a checkpoint in `save_checkpoint_dir`.
            Any future call to the state will internally involve restoring it from memory.
