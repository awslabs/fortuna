Conformer
===========
Conformers are calibration methods that, starting from uncertainty estimates, provide *conformal sets*, i.e. rigorous
sets of predictions with a user-chosen level of probability. We support some conformal methods for both
:ref:`classification <conformer_classification>`
and :ref:`regression <conformer_regression>`.
