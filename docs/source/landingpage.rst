A Library for Uncertainty Quantification
========================================
Proper estimation of predictive uncertainty is fundamental in applications that involve critical decisions.
Uncertainty can be used to assess reliability of model predictions, trigger human intervention,
or decide whether a model can be safely deployed in the wild.

Fortuna provides calibrated uncertainty estimates of model predictions, in classification and regression.
It is designed to be easy-to-use,
and to promote effortless estimation of uncertainty in production systems.
