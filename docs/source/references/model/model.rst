Model
============================
A deterministic model from inputs to outputs.
You can choose among several :ref:`built-in models <builtin_models>`,
or bring in your own model by overwriting :mod:`~flax.linen.Module`.
The model forward pass is orchestrated by a :ref:`model manager <model_manager>`.
